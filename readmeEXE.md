Welcome to ChpFldr!
This is YOUR MegaMan Battle Network Chip Folder and guide!
By @JwBZx (Jonathan Bruce/jwbzx.tumblr.com)

This is a JavaScript Application and GitHub guide for all collectors of Megaman Battle Network PET Chips.
You can edit your own Chip Folder and record all of the chips that you have collected.
You can view your Chip Folder that contains all of the chips that you have collected.
And you can get information about Battle Chips like their CP, Attack Points, and more.

Thank You for checking this Application and GitHub Project!
If you have any changes, comments, or ideas, feel free to open an issue or fork the project and work on it!

Thank You and God Bless! :)
